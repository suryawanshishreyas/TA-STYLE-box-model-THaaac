                    Android buttons are GUI components which are sensible to taps (clicks) by the user. When the user taps/clicks on button in an Android app, the app can respond to the click/tap. These buttons can be divided into two categories: the first is Buttons with text on, and second is buttons with an image on. A button with images on can contain both an image and a text. Android buttons with images on are also called ImageButton.
